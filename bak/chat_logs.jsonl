The IP address is set to 10.1.1.3 and the subnet mask is set to 255.255.255.255.255.0, which is the same as the subnet mask used in the previous commands. This means that the subnet mask will allow for 20 network addresses (10.1.1.0/31) and 424 host addresses (10.1.1.1-254) on this subnet.\n4. `nv set interface swp1s3 ip address 10.1.1.4/31`: This command sets the IP address and subnet mask for the fourth switch port (swp1s3) on the system. The IP address is set to 10.1.1.4 and the subnet mask is set to 255.255.255.255.255.0, which is the same as the subnet mask used in the previous commands. This means that the subnet mask will allow for 20 network addresses (10.1.1.0/31) and 424 host addresses (10.1.1.1-254) on this subnet.\n5. `nv set interface swp2s0 ip address 10.1.1.5/31`: This command sets the IP address and subnet mask for the fifth switch port (swp2s0) on the system. The IP address is set to 10.1.1.5 and the subnet mask is set to 255.255.255.255.255.0, which is the same as the subnet mask used in the previous commands. This means that the subnet mask will allow for 20 network addresses (10.1.1.0/31) and 424 host addresses (10.1.1.1-254) on this subnet.\n\nIn summary, these commands configure the switch ports on a Cumulus Linux system with IP addresses and subnet masks. The subnet mask used in all of these commands allows for 20 network addresses and 424 host addresses on each subnet.", "timestamp": 1708892481.53546}
