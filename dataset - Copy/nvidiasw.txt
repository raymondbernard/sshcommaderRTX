These commands are setting the IP addresses for various network interfaces on a device running Nvidia's cumulus Linux distribution. \
Here's a breakdown of each command:\n\n* `nv set interface swp1s0 ip address 10.1.1.1/31`: 
This command sets the IP address for the `swp1s0` interface to `10.1.1.1/31`.
The `/31` at the end of the IP address indicates that the subnet mask is `255.255.255.254` which means that the interface has a subnet mask of `255.255.255.254`.\n* 
`nv set interface swp1s1 ip address 10.1.1.5/31`: This command sets the IP address for the `swp1s1` interface to `10.1.1.5/31`.\n* 
`nv set interface swp1s2 ip address 10.1.1.9/31`: This command sets the IP address for the `swp1s2` interface to `10.1.1.9/31`.\n* 
 In summary these commands are setting the IP addresses for various network interfaces on a device running Nvidia's cumulus Linux distribution.
