The `/31` at the end of each IP address specifies the subnet mask, which defines the network and broadcast addresses for the subnet. In this case, the subnet mask is `255.255.255.240`, which means that the network address is `10.1.1.0` and the broadcast address is `10.1.1.255`.", "timestamp": 1708967686.275771}
