Open the NVIDIA Command Line Interface (CLI) by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Enter.\n2. Type the following command to list all the available interfaces on the NVIDIA switch:\n```\nnv set interface\n```\n3. Identify the interface names of the 16 ports on the NVIDIA switch. The interface names may vary depending on the specific NVIDIA switch model, but they typically start with \"swp\" followed by a number (e.g., swp0, swp1, swp2, etc.).\n4. Assign IP addresses to each of the 16 ports using the following command:\n```\nnv set interface <interface_name> ip address <ip_address>/<subnet_mask>\n```\nReplace `<interface_name>` with the name of the interface you want to configure (e.g., swp0, swp1, swp2, etc.) and `<ip_address>` with the desired IP address for that interface (e.g., 10.1.1.1, 10.1.1.2, etc.). The `/<subnet_mask>` specifies the subnet mask for the IP address, which determines the network and broadcast addresses for the interface.\n5. Repeat step 4 for all 16 ports on the NVIDIA switch.\n6. Verify that the IP addresses have been assigned to the interfaces by running the following command:\n```\nnv set interface\n```\nThis should display the IP addresses assigned to each interface.\n\nNote: The specific commands and syntax may vary depending on the version of NVIDIA CLI you are using. It is recommended to refer to the NVIDIA documentation for your specific NVIDIA switch model for more detailed instructions.", "timestamp": 1708967658.6872888}

The `/31` at the end of each IP address specifies the subnet mask, which defines the network and broadcast addresses for the subnet.
